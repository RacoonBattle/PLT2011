Store passing vs. environment passing
=====================================

In the lecture on mutable state, you have been introduced to store-passing
style. Analogously, we can label the data flow of environments in our
interpreter environment-passing style.

Investigate the relation of environment-passing style and store-passing style.
How does the data flow change when considering a dynamically scoped language
instead of a lexically scoped one?
