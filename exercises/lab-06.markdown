Tail calls
==========

1. Functional programs extensively use function application and recursion
   instead of imperative constructs such as loops. This has consequences on
   performance because many languages support function application and recursion
   only insufficiently. Write a Scala program that illustrates this
   insufficiency.
2. Tail calls are a specific kind of function calls. Define precisely what a
   tail call is.
3. Special support for tail calls can improve the evaluation of function
   programs significantly. Explain how.
4. The "web transformation" linearizes computations. Illustrate this through an
   example and explain the phenomenon. How can we implement a web-transformed
   program efficiently?
