/* Today we study _mutation_. More specifically, we want to equip our language with mutable data
 * structures. Typical mutable data structures in common languages include objects with mutable
 * fields or structures/records in languages like C or Pascal. 
 *
 * We will study a particularly simple mutable data structure: Boxes. In OO parlance, boxes
 * can be thought of as an object with a single field that can be mutated. Despite their simplicity,
 * boxes already illustrate all main issues associated with adding mutable state to a language.
 *
 * A different and less interesting form of mutation is the mutability of _variables_, such as the
 * possibility to assign something to a 'local' variable bound via a lambda or "with". We will not
 * talk about mutable variables today. 
 *
 * We will add boxes to our base language, FAE: */

/* Let's consider the question how the interpreter branch for sequencing could look like. 
 * Here is an attempt:
 
   case Seq(e1,e2) => {
      eval(e1,env)
      eval(e2,env)
   }
   
 * However, this cannot possibly be correct. As long as our interpreter does not use mutation,
 * there is no way how the evaluation of e1 could have any effect on the evaluation of e2.
 * However, this must obviously be the case, as the example above illustrates.
 *
 * To shed light on the actual nature of mutation, we will not use mutation in our interpreter.
 * (cf. discussion about meta-interpretation vs syntactic interpretation in one of the following
 *  lectures)
 * One possibility is that the interpreter always returns a possibly updated environment in addition
 * to the computed value. However, this does not work: First, it would introduce once more a form
 * of dynamic scoping (which we want to avoid), and second, it would not work when closures 
 * are involved. Consider the following example: */

/* The mutation should affect the box stored in the closure bound to f. But with the implementation
 * strategy described above it would not. 
 *
 * Note that changing the value of a in the example is not a violation of static scope. Scoping tells
 * us which occurence of an identifier is bound to which introduction of an identifier, but not its value.
 *
 * Hence, the following two evaluation strategies are both flawed:
 * 1) Using the environment (which maps a to 1) stored in the closure for f when evaluating f(5).
 *    The program will evaluate to 6 rather than 7.
 * 2) Using the environment present at the time of procedure invocation: f(5). This will record the
 *    change to a but reintroduces dynamic scope.
 *
 * Insight: We need _two_ repositories of information. The environment is the guardian of static scope and it
 * maps symbols to values. */
